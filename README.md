# Ruby on Rails starter application (with account management)

This is a starter application based on the sample app for the [*Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Learn Web Devlopment with Rails*](http://www.railstutorial.org/) by [Michael Hartl](http://www.michaelhartl.com/).

The implementation stops at user account management and can be used to bootstrap a rails app requiring user account management.
